while running the script, it will, at the start, ask for input.

this is a sqlite database and depends on the location where you are.
You can fill in the full path if that is needed.
Examples:
Enter the name of the database: aves.db
Enter the name of the database: /home/username/sqlitedatabases/aves

Then you can enter a table prefix, if non is needed, just hit enter.
Examples:
Enter a prefix for table names, leave empty if you don't want a prefix: aves_
Enter a prefix for table names, leave empty if you don't want a prefix: 

The last input it needs, is the basepath to the import files.
This are the .txt files in DCA format.
If they happen to be in the folder you are currently in, just hit enter.

Examples:
Enter the basepath to the import files, leave empty for [/home/username]: /home/username/dca_imports/aves
