<?php

// NOTE: this compiles a list (table) of species not linked to any
// genus, then deletes them to avoid anomalies. Currently there are many.
// What seems to be happening is that the following types of
// species are being deleted:

// 1) species not linked to any genus
// 2) species linked to >1 genus entry

// Type 1 names might be resolved by parsing genus from species name and 
// adding to genus table and name table in core db
// Type 2 names could be resovled by:
// a) Linking to *accepted* genus if exactly 1 accepted genus, or
// b) Linking randomly to one accepted genus if >1 accepted genus, or
// c) Linking randomly to one genus with no taxonomic opinion if no accepted genus, or
// d) Linking ramdomly to one synonymous genus if no accepted genus and no genus without taxonomic opinion

// Implementing the above changes should eliminate orphan genera

// Delete any species still missing a FK to genus
// Not sure if this is necessary; seems prudent to avoid anomalies
